Unfortunately, due to unforeseen financial circumstances, I have encountered challenges in obtaining the required paperwork from my university. I understand the significance of the document for enrollment, and I deeply regret any inconvenience my inability to provide it may have caused.

In lieu of the official university paperwork, I am more than willing to offer alternative forms of verification or any additional information that might assist in validating my academic background or eligibility for the training program. I am enthusiastic about participating in this opportunity to expand my knowledge in embedded Linux and am committed to fulfilling all other requirements needed for enrollment.

I truly value the opportunity this training presents and assure you of my dedication and commitment to completing the program successfully. I apologize once again for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please feel free to contact me if there are any alternative procedures or additional information I can provide to resolve this matter.
